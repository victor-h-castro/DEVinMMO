<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


There are many great game websites available on the internet; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this great one

Here's why:
* You can find almost every game avaible to play 
* You can get flashy news about game wide
* And you can comment, vote and see what the community is up to :smile: Reddit is not ready for it

Much more to come in new releases, but for now we can sure have a great time
